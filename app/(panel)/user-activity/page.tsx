/**
 * User activity — what visitors actually do on the website.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THIS IS NOT `/reports`, AND THE SPLIT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT IS A SEPARATE PAGE ───────────
 * `/reports` is about the PIPELINE: leads, stages, who is working them, what needs chasing. Every
 * figure there is about a person the studio is already talking to. This page is about people the
 * studio has never met and mostly never will — anonymous visits, a loader they may not survive, and
 * how far into the journey they got.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THE PAGE HAS A SHAPE, AND IT IS NOT "EIGHT EQUAL SECTIONS" ───────────────────────────────
 * It used to be, and it was unreadable for exactly that reason: every question was set at the same
 * size with a paragraph of explanation under it, so nothing said which one to read first and the
 * whole page had to be worked through to get one number out of it. It now reads top to bottom as one
 * argument:
 *
 *   1 · THE ANSWER      one figure — did visitors get past the loader — with its counts beside it
 *   2 · WHEN            the shape of arrival over the window
 *   3 · HOW FAR         where they got to once inside
 *   4 · THE DETAIL      everything else, demoted into a grid of small cards
 *   5 · THE PICTURES    heatmaps, which are the most interesting and the least conclusive
 *
 * ⚠ The explanatory prose is deliberately gone from most cards. What survives is the caveat a reader
 * would MISREAD the number without — the heatmap's per-section normalisation, the dead/rage
 * definitions — and nothing that merely restates the title in a longer form.
 *
 * ⚠ Admin-only, and for the same reason `/inbox` and `/applications` are: `journey_events` has no
 * owner column, so `visibility.ts` has nothing to scope a salesperson's view by. The role is the
 * whole gate.
