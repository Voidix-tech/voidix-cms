/**
 * The nightly job: fold the raw stream into daily counts, then delete what has been counted.
 *
 * ── ⚠ ROLL UP FIRST, DELETE SECOND, AND NEVER THE OTHER WAY ────────────────────────────────────
 * Obvious written down, easy to reverse when someone later "tidies" the order. Deleting first
 * discards the rows the rollup was about to read, and the loss is silent — the job reports success
 * and the day simply has no history.
 *
 * ── ⚠ WHY RE-RUNNING THIS CANNOT ZERO AN EARLIER DAY ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The natural fear with an upsert over a table that is being emptied: roll up Monday, delete
 * Monday's raw rows, run again, and Monday recomputes as zero and overwrites itself.
 *
 * It cannot happen, and the reason is structural rather than a guard. The rollup is `INSERT … SELECT
 * … GROUP BY`, so a day with no remaining raw rows produces NO ROW AT ALL — there is nothing for
 * `ON CONFLICT` to update, and the stored figures stand untouched. If this is ever rewritten as a
 * read-then-write in application code, that property is lost and the guard becomes real work.
 *
 * ── ⚠ ONLY COMPLETE DAYS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `received_at < date_trunc('day', now())` — today is still accumulating, and a partial day written
 * into a table meant for finished ones would be indistinguishable from a quiet one.

 * version; this is where the two representations actually meet.
 *
 * ⚠ The median guards its own cast. `detail->>'dwellMs'` is text out of JSONB and exists on exactly
 * one event type, so the regex is what stops a malformed or unexpected value aborting the entire
